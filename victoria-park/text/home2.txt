In the latter half of the 19th Century, Victoria Park became an essential amenity for the working classes of the East End. For some East End children in the 1880s, this may have been the only large stretch of uninterrupted greenery they ever encountered. Facilities like the Bathing Pond later superseded by the park lido would have introduced many to swimming in an era when many public baths (like that at Shacklewell) were still simply communal washing facilities.
