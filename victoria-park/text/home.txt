Victoria Park is one of Londonâ€™s most important historic parks and its oldest public park, visited by millions of Londoners for nearly 170 years as a place of healthy recreation, sports, play and relaxation.
The park is the largest in Tower Hamlets at 86.18 hectares and has one of the highest visitor numbers of all the London parks with around 9 million visits per year. A wide range of formal and informal sports, sponsored activities, events and festivals take place throughout the year.
Victoria Park is a key link in a green corridor that stretches from the River Thames at Limehouse, along the Regents Canal and through Mile End Park, along with the new Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park virtually next door.  The park is bordered on its northern boundary by the London Borough of Hackney.
Once again in 2015 Victoria Park was successful in retaining its Green Flag and Green Heritage Awards, for the fifth year. In addition to this, it regained its crown as the nation's favourite park, coming first place in the People's Choice Award.
